Proofing
========

The Proofing stage allows us to request proofreading from any of:

- The journal editors
- Users with the proofreader role
- Authors of the article

Much like Production we can assign a Proofing Manager to undertake the proofing stage on the Editors behalf or we can assign ourselves as the proofing manager. Either way Editors retain access to the Proofing Manager pages.

From this page we can assign proofreaders and upload new Galley files. To add a new Proofreader select Add New Proofreader.

Adding a Proofreader
--------------------

1. Select the files we want the proofreader to view. XML will be rendered into HTML and PDFs and EPUBs will be displayed in the browser.
All other file types will be served as downloads.

2. Select the proofreader. The list of potential proofreaders is made up of Editors, Users with the Proofreader role and the Authors of the paper. You can only select one proofreader but can add multiple assignments.

3. Task, you can use this text box to define the task for the proofreader eg. Please undertake a technical reading of theses galleys.

4. Due Date allows you to set a date for the task to be complete, please ensure you give people a reasonable amount of time to complete the task.
