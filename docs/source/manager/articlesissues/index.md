- Large Image File
    - The large image is a file used in the heading of the article page on some themes. It is resized to 720x324 px upon uploading so it is recommended an image be either this size or larger. This image will also be used as the meta image if none is supplied and will be used on the carousel when Article display is enabled there.
- Thumbnail
    - The thumbnail is displayed on article listing pages like the All Articles list or the Issue Articles list,
- Meta Image
    - The meta image allows you to override the image displayed when the article is shared on social media. If no meta image is supplied the large image file is used.
