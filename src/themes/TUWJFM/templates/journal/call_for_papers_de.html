Due to the high scientific level the congress is one of the leading conventions in Facility Management in Europe. <br>We are pleased to invite researchers and scientists to submit their abstracts and papers! <br>The papers accepted will be published in the “Journal fuer Facility Management” and a selection will be presented at the congress.</p><p>Information about the actual Call for Papers:</p><p><a title="Call for Papers 2019" href="https://www.ub.tuwien.ac.at/repositum/data/ifm-journal/Call_for_Papers_2019_engl.pdf">Call for Papers 2019</a></p><p>Guideline for authors: (word-document, can be used as a template for the paper)</p><p><a title="Guideline for Authors" href="https://www.ub.tuwien.ac.at/repositum/data/ifm-journal/Guideline_12th_IFM_Congress_2019.pdf">Guideline for Authors</a></p><h1>Peer Review Process</h1><p>In the first stage authors submit abstract for the Call for Papers. Submitted abstracts and papers are evaluated in a double blind peer review process. All submissions are anonymized by the editorial staff.The editorial board conducts a first review and selects- according to the field of research-&nbsp;at least&nbsp;two&nbsp;members of the&nbsp;scientific committee as reviewer. An invitation is sent to reviewers. Reviewers analyse abstracts according to content, scientific quality and significance for FM. They send comments and numerical ratings to the editor.The editorial staff checks, if evaluations and comments are complete: Abstracts are either fully accepted, rejected or rejected until comments of reviewers are included in the full paper. The authors of the accepted abstracts and the ones with demand for improvement are provided with reviewers comments and are invited to hand in a full paper.</p><p>The second stage follows the same rules: The same reviewers as in the first stage give their comments and ratings on the full paper. If the paper is rejected until comments of reviewers are included, authors are asked to follow the recommendations and hand the changed paper in again for a final evaluation.</p><p>If reviewers or the editorial board find out research misconduct or are made aware about this, in a first step a plagiarism check is performed and a formal request is sent to authors.</p><p>Accepted papers will be published in the Journal for Facility Management. The authors of the best papers are invited to present their paper at the annual IFM Congress at TU Wien, Vienna University of Technology.</p><h1><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></h1><p>Authors have to follow the general principles of scientific practice, as described in TU Viennas ‘<a href="https://www.tuwien.ac.at/dle/universitaetskanzlei/richtlinien_und_verordnungen/code_of_conduct_fuer_wissenschaftliches_arbeiten/">Code of Conduct</a>’.
